#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the implication of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems that are of high quality. Software engineering is vital in the technology industry because it enables the creation of an amplitude of software systems as well as systems that affect our everyday lives like communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of high-level programming languages
The rise of Agile methodologies to enhance more sophisticated projects
The establishment of discipline in of software engineering which provides consistency 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - the documentation and gathering of system and user requirements.
 Design – the creation of the user interface architecture of the software in high level detail
Implementation – the writing of code and implementing the software design according to the specifications
  Testing – ensures that the functionality and quality of the software works as intended by performing a range of tests 
 Deployment – is the release of the software to live users (the client)
  Maintenance – ensures that the software is improved and updated regularly after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall methodology is a linear approach that falls into sequential phases like a waterfall e.g., requirements, design, implementation which are very difficult to revisit once a phase has been approved and a new phase has began. The methodology risks financial loss and wasted time due to setbacks. Waterfall works perfectly for projects that have a clear, concise plan and focus on finishing goals on a step-by-step bases e.g. a construction project like the building of a house or a bridge which would require minimal or no change at all also another project would be a payroll system for employees.
 
 Agile methodology has an iterative approach that accumulates constant feedback which makes easier for adjustments during the development phase. There is room for flexibility and input from the client. Work and time aren’t wasted as the team working on the project can cross reference each other’s work and problems are discovered early on and can be dealt with accordingly. Agile works for projects that constantly change over time like and ecommerce app or a banking app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 
Software Developer is responsible for designing, programming, deploying and maintaining software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software meets the quality standards by identifying areas of improvement. Designing and executing test plans as well as detecting defects and logging them.
Project Manager is responsible for the planning, execution and deliverance project by overseeing the overall software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments are a range of tools in placed in one platform provided for developers to write, debug and test code e.g. visual studio code.
 
 Version Control Systems is a tool that helps manage the code overtime like modifications and changes e.g. GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Complex requirements - the misunderstanding of requirements during development can lead to confusion and cause delays within the project. Clear effective communication to avoid mishaps.
Technical Debt – shortcuts during the development like quick bug fixes can lead to technical debt and make it harder to maintain and debug the code in the future as it accumulates. Performing regular assessments and refactoring can improve the quality of the code.
  Handling Tight Deadlines – tight deadlines can lead to stress and pressure which can result in rushed development, compromised quality and affect team morale. To avoid being compromised teams should focus on time management and prioritizing manageable tasks based on value.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing is the testing of an isolated code which is individually tested to ensure that it works as intended.
Integration Testing focuses on testing the different components.
System Testing focuses on testing the system completely involving an end-to-end test to check the overall behaviour of the system.
Acceptance Testing focuses on the user’s needs to check whether the requirements are meet and if the software is ready to be released 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the creation and crafting of questions to get the most accurate, relevant and best possible answers from AI models. The interaction with AI models helps to minimize ambiguity and maximize accuracy so that the AI understands exactly what the user needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
If I prompt the model with “Food” it won’t really know what to do with that statement but if I say  “ Provide a list of high- fibre food” the statement is clear and specific and the AI model  will know exactly what to output back.
